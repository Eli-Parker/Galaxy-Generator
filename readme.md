# Three.js Journey
This code is a part of a lesson in the Three.JS Journey, which has been lightly modified to include some of my personal changes and menus.


## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
